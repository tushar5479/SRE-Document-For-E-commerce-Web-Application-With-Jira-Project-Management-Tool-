A Web Based E-Commerce Application with Delivery System   
Problem: Multivendor e-commerce poses challenges for buyers purchasing from different vendors, including uncertain delivery schedules and cumulative delivery fees. Coordinated shipping options and combined delivery fees could streamline the process, reducing financial setbacks and time-related inconveniences for customers. Improved communication on delivery status is crucial for a more seamless multivendor shopping experience.

Solution : A proposed system acts as an intermediary in multivendor e-commerce, automatically accepting single-vendor orders and identifying the optimal seller for multiple-vendor orders based on speed and affordability. It categorizes products, notifies relevant vendors, and ensures efficient delivery to the e-commerce company's pick-up location for customer distribution.
